                        <p>Valeyo wanted to upgrade their legacy products to a new digital-first platform. <mark>Their legacy products UX/UI were outdated and lenders could not complete loans/applications 100% digitally as they had to resort to offline tasks as well.</mark> I designed for two of their new products, which were Ori (the loan origination software) and Nova (the insurance application software). </p>

                        <p>My time at Constellation Software - Valeyo, I had the privilege to work with 3 different product teams.  The teams were Insurance, Lending, and Banking. Each team had a different style of working, 
                            how they measure workload, how they release product updates, who calls the shots, different roadblocks, and of course the different products they work on. I quickly booked 1on1 meetings with 
                            the leads on each team (Product, and Development), then I reached out to individuals on the team that I would be working with more closely such as the Intermediate Developer or Senior Analysts.</p>
